This package contains classes for the generation of data entity types from database tables. The easiest ways to generate an entity is by invoking CreateTableTemplate from the command line like this:
<blockquote>
<code>
java de.mathema.pride.CreateTableTemplate driver db user password table [class]
</code>
</blockquote>
where <code><i>driver</i></code> is the name of the database driver class, <code><i>db</i></code> the URL of the database, <code><i>user</i></code> the database login name, <code><i>password</i></code> the password for the account, and <code><i>table</i></code> the name of the database table to generate an entity for. The results are written to standard out.<br>
CreateTableTemplate as fragemented into several member functions generating the various perts of an entity type definition. If you are not satisfied with the default outcome of the generator, you can easily provide your own derivation where you can override the functions as desired.
