How to build a new PriDE release
--------------------------------

  1. Extend PriDE-History.html by appropriate release information

  2. Potentially update PriDE version numbers and release dates in
PriDE-About.html, PriDE.html, and readme.txt

  3. Update the last-published short comment in index.html

  4. Update the version number in plugin.xml

  5. Run ant clean

  6. Copy the complete PriDE working directory to a directory
named pride<version>-src

  7. Check the copy for undeliverable files. Especially the
workshop directory must be removed. Also check the lib directory
which should only contain junit.jar

  8. Zip the directory to pride<version>-src.zip. The directory
pride<version>-src is supposed to make up the root for the zip
content.

  9. In the PriDE working directory run ant compile

 10. Run ant javadoc

 11. Run ant jar

 12. Run ant zip

 13. Rename the created pride.zip in pride<version>.zip

 14. Upload the zip files

 15. Upload the modified online documentation, i.e. at least
PriDE-History.html and index.html
