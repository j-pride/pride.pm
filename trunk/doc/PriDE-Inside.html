<h2> Basic Design Principles</h2>
      PriDE gains its simplicity from a few important design decisions assuming
   an application architecture based on approved and widly recommended design
   patterns. This allows to dispense with some popular features which make
 O/R  mapping toolkits fat and sometimes cause a kind of uncontrollable and
 unexplainable  self-will when being used extensively. Many of these design
 patterns are related to a layered software architecture which is most often
 used for the design of distributed 3-tier systems. However, a layered architecture
 is in general reasonable and strongly recommended for any system of a certain 
 complexity, not regarding its physical distribution. Applications of low 
complexity can usually live with a low-complexity persistence management anyway.
So a closer look on PriDE's design concepts is mainly of interest for middle
and large scale systems.      
<h3> Pure value object approach</h3>
      In a layered system architecture it is commonly recommended to use
value    objects like Java Beans for communication between client and server
components    (see e.g. J2EE Blueprint patterns) rather than passing persistence-aware 
  objects around, like Entity Beans in EJB CMP or instrumented entites in 
JDO.  PriDE simply relies on a value object approach all through the system, 
even  on the O/R mapping level. I.e. for database updates, PriDE gets passed 
pure  value objects by the caller and it returns pure value objects as result
  from a query. Copying data from persistence-aware objects to value objects
  can be ommitted.      
<h3> No relationship support</h3>
      Another recommendation for layered systems is to hide database access 
 in  appropriate facade components and liberate higher levels from any details
   concerning restrictions or capabilities of the database or the persistence
   manager (see e.g. design pattern Data Access Object from the J2EE blueprints).
   As a consequence, relationship navigation is mainly hidden in the low-level
   implementation of Data Access Objects and thus becomes of minor importance.
   It could therefore as well be substituted by a less transparent approach
  as long as it provides similar convenience. <a
 href="PriDE-Patterns-Relationship.html">PriDE-Patterns-Relationship.html</a>
demonstrates   how to implement inter-object navigation on PriDE's value
object approach   in a very convenient way. Some O/R mapping toolkits as
well as the EJB CMP   2.0 standard also proclaim some features for relationship
manipulation to   be essential like cascade delete and preservation of referencial
integrity.   However, implicite mechanisms like these tend to cause difficult
to understand   system behaviour when being used extensively. Moreover they
can just cover   a very few <i>technical</i> constraints and don't guarantee
data consistency   from a <i>business</i> point of view which still needs
explicit coding.  PriDE doesn't support relationships at all, assuming that
any kind of inter-object   dependencies are maintained by the business logic.
     
<h3> Explicit load and store operations</h3>
      PriDE does not attempt to provide any load and store optimization.
Read   and write operations called by the application will always cause immediate
  database access. Database updates always have to be called explicitly by 
the application. If client components get passed value objects anyway (see 
above), it is also the client's task to fetch and send data only where it 
is actually needed to reduce the communication traffic between client and 
server interactions. Otherwise the problem would only have been shifted from 
the server-database layer to the client-server layer. So if the client already 
takes care for an interaction reduction with its server components, there 
is usually not much to optimize on lower levels.      
<h3> No instance management</h3>
      As a consequence of the approach above, PriDE does not perform any
management    of instances it got passed for update or it returned from a
query. It does    not guarantee any object identity, i.e. if the same database
record is queried  more than once, PriDE will potentially return multiple
objects representing   the same database record. Object identity and object
management is lost on  the way to the client anyway when the data is passed
as a value object on  a higher level. In the other direction the management
of persistent-aware    objects just causes additional coding work to associate
the client's value    objects with a managed entity again. This makes sense
only if the managed    entities provide some key features like store optimization.
However, PriDE    does not provide any features which require an instance
management and so  it just keeps from doing so. As an advantage, PriDE's
performance is always  predictable and never suffers from transparent instance
management in the  background, which often turned out to cause much more
trouble in practice  than it solves.<br>
         
<h3>No XML-based descriptors</h3>
     PriDE follows a very pragmatic approach of mapping Java object attributes 
  to database record fields. The mapping description is itself just an object 
  which is usually declared as a static member of adapter classes or self-describing 
  value types. As an advantage over XML-based descriptors (as required for 
 most O/R mapping toolkits today), a descriptor object is much more flexible 
 to use e.g. for optimizations or special cases as demonstrated in <a
 href="PriDE-Patterns-Query.html">PriDE-Patterns-Query.html</a> (class <tt>MaxDescriptor</tt>). 
  An XML-based representation for standard descriptors should just be a externalization 
  form, available as an optional feature and not as an integral, mandatory 
 part of the core toolkit itself. Moreover it is somehow unsuitable for a 
simple framework with a library of about 60 kbyte size, to be based on megabytes-sized 
  XML parser frameworks and all the incompatibility problems between these.<br>
     PriDE is 100% XML-free.<br>
