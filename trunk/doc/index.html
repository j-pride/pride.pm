      <h3> <a name="What is PriDE?">What is PriDE?</a> </h3>
PriDE is an ultra-thin and high-performance Java O/R mapper for
relational databases, originally developed by <a
 href="http://www.mathema.de">MATHEMA Software GmbH</a>. It doesn't
follow
any persistence management standards but relies on common design
patterns
and is production-proved in both J2SE and J2EE environments. PriDE can
really claim to be the world's smallest <i></i>persistence manager,
coming
as a single library of less than 100k, without requiring XML and
appropriate parser frameworks or other helper libraries beside the JDK.<br>
      <br>
PriDE gains its simplicity from a few <a href="PriDE-Inside.html">important
design decisions</a> assuming an application architecture based on
approved and widly recommended design patterns. This allows to dispense
with some popular features which make O/R mapping toolkits fat and
sometimes cause a kind of uncontrollable
and unexplainable self-will when being used extensively. Many of these
design patterns are related to a layered software architecture which is
most often used for the design of distributed 3-tier systems. However,
a layered architecture is in general reasonable and strongly
recommended for any complex system, not only for distributed
applications.<br>
      <br>
The design was partly inspired by Scott W. Ambler's
white paper "<a href="http://www.ambysoft.com/persistenceLayer.pdf">The
Design of a Robust Persistence Layer For Relational Databases</a>". The
manual provides a <a href="PriDE-Features.html">feature list</a>
allowing to decide if the toolkit matches the individual requirements
in a software development project.<br>
      <h3> <a name="How to learn PriDE?">How to learn PriDE?</a> </h3>
For a quick introduction, it is recommended to have a look at the <a
 href="PriDE-Quickstart.html">quick start tutorial</a>. A complete
overview about PriDE's working principles can be found in the <a
 href="PriDE-Introduction.html">introduction </a>chapter.<br>
      </div>
      <div class="h3">
      <h3><a name="Why another O/R mapping toolkit?">Why another O/R
mapping toolkit?</a></h3>
Allthough PriDE wasn't released as an OpenSource project before mid of
2003, this toolkit is not new at all. It is already in use silently in
various different production systems as it can
be seen from the <a href="references.html">reference list</a>. And
allthough a lot of O/R mappers have already been released, refined, and
evolved over years now, it is still a fact that the most simple
persistence management approaches have the best chance to lead to a
stable solution. Simplicity turned out to be a key attribute for such a
critical thing like database access which is the performance bottle
neck for most software system's. PriDE provides both crucial developer
convenience as supposed by an O/R mapper, and an absolutely slim
framework implementation which can actually be understood and
maintained by its users if necessary.<br>
      <br>
PriDE claims to be high-performant in the sense, that it does not waste
mentionable time over pure JDBC. In particular it
allows e.g. fast processing of large result sets which is a known
problem with standards like JDO or EJB-CMP. It does not show any
side-effects by transparent caching, relationship or entity management
and thus doesn't cause bad surprises when being used in large-scale
projects. It does <i>not </i>claim to be <i>faster </i>than the
database itself, as it does not automatically perform any caching,
expression optimization, or load/store-optimization. Optimization is
supposed to
be in the application's responsibility as it often turned out in
practice
that automatic optimizations by persistence managers caused at least
as many problems as they solve.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>PriDE integrates with <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cuba/">CUBA</a></h3>
CUBA is a small OpenSource framework for the development of components
which can be run as EJBs, AXIS WebServices, or in a stand-alone
application. PriDE can be used as a persistence manager for CUBA
components. Check out the examples on the CUBA website at <a
